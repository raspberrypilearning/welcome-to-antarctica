- ( ) `<link>`

  \--- feedback ---

  Not quite. The `<link>` tag is used to define external resources, such as stylesheets, but not for creating hyperlinks.

- ( ) `<span>`

  \--- feedback ---

Not quite. The `<span>` tag is used for grouping in-line elements and applying styles, not for creating hyperlinks.

- (x) `<a>`

  \--- feedback ---

Correct! The `<a>` tag is used to create hyperlinks in HTML. It stands for "anchor" and is followed by the href attribute, specifying the link destination.
