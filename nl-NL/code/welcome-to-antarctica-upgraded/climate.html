          <p class="fact">
            Antarctica is the coldest continent on Earth. The average temperature in the interior is -57°C, and during winter it can reach -90°C. The coast is warmer and temperatures can reach a maximum of 8°C during the summer.

        <span class="fact-card sunburn">
          <p class="fact">
            You can get sunburn on Antarctica as the snow reflects nearly all of the sun's ultraviolet rays. You may not feel the heat, but you still need to keep your skin safe from the rays.

        <span class="fact-card ice">
          <p class="fact">
            Antarctica's ice sheet is, on average, 1.6km thick and covers about 98% of the continent. This ice sheet is nearly 90% of the entire world’s ice!
          </p>

        <span class="fact-card rainfall">
          <p class="fact">
            Technically, Antarctica is a desert because it is so dry there. The average annual precipitation on the coast is just 166mm. With such cold conditions, the snow hardly ever melts. Instead, most of it is compressed over time and becomes part of the ice sheet.
