              Antarctica is the coldest continent, but it is also the driest! On average, there is just 200mm (8 inches) of precipitation a year, the majority of it along the coast.

              The continent is thought to have been discovered relatively late in human history. In 1820, Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen and Mikhail Lazarev lead a Russian expedition to prove the exsistence of Antarctica and were probably the first to see the ice shelves.

              Antarctica is governed by the Antarctic Treaty. First signed by 12 nations in 1959, the Treaty now has 56 supporting nations, 29 of which are considered “Consultative Parties” and are actively involved in decision-making.
