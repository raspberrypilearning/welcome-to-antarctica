## Introduction

### New to the Raspberry Pi Editor?

Check out the [getting started guide](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/getting-started-guide-editor-html){:target="_blank"}.

In this project, you will use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a website that lets people discover a place they may never get a chance to visit — Antarctica. 

As well as the homepage, the website will have pages about Antarctica's wildlife and climate. 

<p style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;">
<span style="color: #0faeb0">**JavaScript**</span> is a programming language that runs in your browser. As of 2024, it is the most popular programming language in the world!
