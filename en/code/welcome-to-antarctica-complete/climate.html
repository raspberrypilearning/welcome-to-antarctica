                    <p class="fact">
                        Antarctica is the coldest continent on Earth. The average temperature in the interior throughout the year is about -57°C, with the minimum temperature being -90°C during the winter season. Although the coast is warmer and temperatures can reach a maximum of between -2°C and 8°C during the summer. It is, on average, the coldest, windiest, and driest of all the continents on Earth.

                    <p class="fact">
                        Strangely enough, one can suffer serious sunburn whilst there as the snow acts as a reflector which reflects nearly all the ultraviolet rays, so although you may not feel the heat, you still need to make sure to keep your skin safe from the rays.

                        This ice sheet is, on average, 1.6 km thick and covers about 98% of the entire continent; this is nearly 90% of the entire world’s ice, so it’s no wonder the Antarctic climate is so cold!

                    <p class="fact">
                        Technically, Antarctica is a desert because it is so dry there; with an average annual precipitation of just 166mm along the coastal regions, and even less when moving further inland. With such cold conditions the snow hardly ever melts; instead, it will mostly become compressed over time to form part of the ice sheet. This is known as an ice cap climate (classified as a continent where the average monthly temperature never exceeds 0°C).
