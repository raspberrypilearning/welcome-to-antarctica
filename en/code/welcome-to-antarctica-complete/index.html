              You probably know it’s the coldest continent on the planet, but
              did you know Antarctica is also the driest? On average, the 7th
              Continent sees just 200 mm (8 in) of precipitation a year, the
              majority of it along the coast.

              The southernmost continent is thought to have been discovered
              relatively late in human history, in 1820 by the Russian
              expedition of Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen and Mikhail
              Lazarev.

              One of the more controversial Antarctic facts among historians is
              who first set foot on the continent. Many believe it was sealer
              John Davis in February, 1821. However, the first documented and
              confirmed landing was by a whaling and sealing Antarctic
              expedition in January, 1895. A crew led by Norwegian Leonard
              Kristensen landed a small boat with six men aboard from their ship
              - aptly named Antarctic - at Cape Adare.

                Antarctica is governed by the Antarctic Treaty system, which
                suspends all territorial claims. First signed by 12 nations in
                1959, the Treaty now has 53 supporting nations, 29 of which are
                considered “Consultative Parties” and are actively involved in
                decision-making.
