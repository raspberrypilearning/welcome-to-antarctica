              <p class="fact">
                  Emperor penguins, like all penguins in Antarctica, live in colonies dotted around the coastline.
                  Emperor penguins are unique in having colonies on sea ice. Sea ice is frozen sea water which
                  fringes the Antarctic continent. In the winter, the sea ice extent expands. In the summer, it
                  shrinks as the sea ice melts. By the time the chicks are ready to fledge, the sea ice edge is
                  close to the colony, so the young penguins don’t have to travel far to get their food.

          <span class="fact-card krill">
              <p class="fact">
                  The producer in Antarctica are tiny organisms, known as phytoplankton. These organisms get their
                  energy from the sunlight. Krill is then the main consumer of the phytoplankton, which is eaten
                  by many other organisms such as penguins, birds, or even ginormous elephant seals! Because there
                  are so many different organisms feeding from the krill, there needs to be lots and lots of krill
                  available, especially as they are only 2 inches long!

              <p class="fact">
                  There are many different seals in Antarctica. They have thick beautiful fur coats and blubber,
                  making them supremely adapted to the cold. There are six species in Antarctica: Antarctic Fur
                  Seals, Leopard Seals, Ross Seals, Southern Elephant seals, Crabeater Seals and Weddell Seals.

              <p class="fact">
                  At the top of the food chain, there are Orcas, often known as Killer Whales. These are the
                  biggest carnivores on Earth, reaching almost 10m in length! They can be found swimming all
                  around the Earth’s oceans, but in particular in the Southern Ocean around Antarctica.
