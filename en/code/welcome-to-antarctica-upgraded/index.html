              Antarctica is the coldest continent, but it is also the driest! On average, there is just 200mm (8 inches) of precipitation a year, the majority of it along the coast.

          <span class="fact-card discovery">
            <p class="fact">
              The continent is thought to have been discovered relatively late in human history. In 1820, Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen and Mikhail Lazarev lead a Russian expedition to prove the exsistence of Antarctica and were probably the first to see the ice shelves.

              Who first set foot on the continent? The first documented and confirmed landing was a crew led by Norwegian Leonard Kristensen at Cape Adare.

              Antarctica is governed by the Antarctic Treaty. First signed by 12 nations in 1959, the Treaty now has 56 supporting nations, 29 of which are considered “Consultative Parties” and are actively involved in decision-making.

          <span class="fact-card research">
            <p class="fact">
              Of the 56 countries that have signed the Antarctic Treaty, 55 of them operate some sort of research station on the continent. The number of researchers active on Antartica is roughly 4,800 in the summer and 1,200 in the winter.
