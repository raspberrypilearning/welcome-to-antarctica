          <span class="fact-card penguins">
            <p class="fact">
              Emperor penguins live in colonies on sea ice. Sea ice is frozen sea water and it forms a fringe around the Antarctic continent. In the winter, the area covered in sea ice expands. In the summer, the area shrinks as the sea ice melts. By the time the chicks are ready to fledge, the sea ice edge is close to the colony, so the young penguins don’t have to travel far to get their food.

          <span class="fact-card krill">
            <p class="fact">
              Krill is eaten by many organisms, such as penguins, birds, and even the ginormous elephant seal! Because there are so many different organisms that feed on krill, there needs to be lots and lots of krill available, especially as they are only 5cm (2 inches) long!

          <span class="fact-card seals">
            <p class="fact">
              Seals have thick fur coats and blubber, making them supremely well adapted to the cold. There are six species in Antarctica: Antarctic fur seals, Leopard seals, Ross seals, Southern elephant seals, Crabeater seals, and Weddell seals.

          <span class="fact-card orcas">
            <p class="fact">
              At the top of the food chain are the orcas, often known as killer whales. These are the biggest carnivores on Earth. They can reach almost 10m in length! Orcas can be found swimming all around the Earth’s oceans, but in particular in the Southern Ocean around Antarctica.

          <span class="fact-card gentoo-penguin">
            <p class="fact">
              Gentoo penguins are less likely to stick together than other penguins and can be found in small groups, sometimes with other species. They have white patches extending from their eyes and a bright red-orange beak. No one knows where the name ‘gentoo’ came from. They are one of the most rare Antarctic penguins.
            </p>
          </span>
          <span class="fact-card albatross">
            <p class="fact">
              The wandering albatross is the largest of the seabirds, with a wing span reaching 3m and a body mass of 8 to 12kg. They have very long lifespans, with some individuals living to over 60 years of age.
