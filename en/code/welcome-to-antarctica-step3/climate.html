              Antarctica is the coldest continent on Earth. The average temperature in the interior is -57°C, during winter it can reach -90°C. The coast is warmer and temperatures can reach a maximum of 8°C during the summer.

              It is possible to get sunburn on Antarctica, the snow reflects nearly all the ultraviolet rays. You may not feel the heat, but you still need to keep your skin safe from the rays.

              This ice sheet is, on average, 1.6 km thick and covers about 98% of the entire continent. This ice sheet is nearly 90% of the entire world’s ice, so it’s no wonder the Antarctic climate is so cold!

              Technically, Antarctica is a desert because it is so dry there. The average annual precipitation on the coast is just 166mm. With such cold conditions the snow hardly ever melts; instead, it will mostly become compressed over time to form part of the ice sheet.
