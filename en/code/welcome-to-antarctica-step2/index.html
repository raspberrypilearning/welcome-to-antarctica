              Antarctica is the coldest continent, but it is also the driest! On average there just 200 mm (8 in) of precipitation a year, the majority of it along the coast.

              The continent is thought to have been discovered relatively late in human history, in 1820 by the Russian expedition of Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen and Mikhail Lazarev.

              Who first set foot on the continent? The first documented and confirmed landing was a crew led by Norwegian Leonard Kristensen at Cape Adare.

              Antarctica is governed by the Antarctic Treaty. First signed by 12 nations in 1959, the Treaty now has 53 supporting nations, 29 of which are considered “Consultative Parties” and are actively involved in decision-making.
