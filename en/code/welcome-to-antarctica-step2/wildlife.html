              Emperor penguins, like all penguins in Antarctica, live in
              colonies dotted around the coastline. Emperor penguins are unique
              in having colonies on sea ice. Sea ice is frozen sea water which
              fringes the Antarctic continent. In the winter, the sea ice extent
              expands. In the summer, it shrinks as the sea ice melts. By the
              time the chicks are ready to fledge, the sea ice edge is close to
              the colony, so the young penguins don’t have to travel far to get
              their food.

              The producer in Antarctica are tiny organisms, known as
              phytoplankton. These organisms get their energy from the sunlight.
              Krill is then the main consumer of the phytoplankton, which is
              eaten by many other organisms such as penguins, birds, or even
              ginormous elephant seals! Because there are so many different
              organisms feeding from the krill, there needs to be lots and lots
              of krill available, especially as they are only 2 inches long!

              There are many different seals in Antarctica. They have thick
              beautiful fur coats and blubber, making them supremely adapted to
              the cold. There are six species in Antarctica: Antarctic Fur
              Seals, Leopard Seals, Ross Seals, Southern Elephant seals,
              Crabeater Seals and Weddell Seals.

              At the top of the food chain, there are Orcas, often known as
              Killer Whales. These are the biggest carnivores on Earth, reaching
              almost 10m in length! They can be found swimming all around the
              Earth’s oceans, but in particular in the Southern Ocean around
              Antarctica.
