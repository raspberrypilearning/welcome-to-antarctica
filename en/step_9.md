You can use the class `research` to add a new background image to this fact!

**Wildlife**

There are three more pictures of antartic wildlife - choose one to add to your `wildlife.html` page. 

You can use the classes...

`albatross` - an image of the Antarctice Albatross.
`minke-whale` - for the Antarctic Minke Whale.
`gentoo-penguin` - for another penguin the Gentoo species.

Research the animal online and add an interesting fact about them to your page!

### Adjust your grids

You can also change the grids on your pages to adjust the way your facts are displayed. 

By adjusting the `fact-holder` and `fact-holder-wildlife` classes you can add extra columns or rows. 

You could also add the the background image classes to place your items across rows and columns to customise your layouts. 

### Change your hero images

In the starter projects there are multiple images you can use for your hero images.

Images you have not used yet are...

`antarctic-landscape.jpg`
`antarctic-seasons.jpg`
`antarctic-walk.jpg`

You can change the image URL in the CSS classes for your hero images to make the site your own.
