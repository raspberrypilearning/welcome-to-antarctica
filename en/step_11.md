<p>Of the 56 countries that have signed the Antarctic Treaty, 55 of them operate some sort of research station on the continent. The number of researchers active on Antartica is roughly 4,800 in the summer and 1,200 in the winter.</p>

### Adjust your grids

You can also change the grids on your pages to adjust the way your facts are displayed. 

--- collapse ---

---
title: Add extra columns and rows
---

You can edit the the `fact-holder` and `fact-holder-wildlife` classes to add more rows or columns. 

--- code ---
---
language: css
filename: 
line_numbers: false
line_number_start: 
line_highlights: 
---

/* Fact holder - homepage */
.fact-holder {
  display: grid;
  height: 70vh; /* 70% of the visible area of the page */
  grid-template-rows: 33% 33% 33%;
  grid-template-columns: 50% 50%;
}

--- /code ---

You could also add `grid-row-start` and `grid-row-end` properties, or `grid-column-start` and `grid-colum-end` to the background image classes to place your items across rows and columns to customise your layouts.
